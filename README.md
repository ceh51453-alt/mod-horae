> *Horae — Greek goddesses who governed the orderly progression of time*

Long-form RP players know the pain: AI memory is basically a goldfish. Yesterday's events become "this morning," costumes change between paragraphs, NPC relationships flip, gifted items vanish, and discarded ones reappear.

**Horae gives your AI a reliable memory ledger using structured time anchors.**

## Features

### Core Memory System
- **Timeline Tracking** — Events are timestamped with relative time calculations ("yesterday", "last Wednesday", "2 months ago"). AI finally knows the difference.
- **Costume Lock** — Each character's current outfit is recorded and only sent for present characters. No more phantom wardrobe changes.
- **NPC Tracking** — Appearance, personality, relationships tracked independently. Ages advance with story time. Relationship prompts are strictly enforced.
- **Item Inventory** — Unique ID system with Normal / Important / Critical tiers. Smart quantity parsing, auto-detection of consumed items.
- **Agenda** — AI automatically records plot promises and deadlines. Completed items are auto-removed.
- **Mood & Relationships** — Emotion tracking keeps characters consistent. Relationship network records bonds between characters. Both are change-driven: zero output when nothing changes.
- **Scene Memory** — Records fixed physical features of locations for consistent descriptions across visits.

### RPG System (Modular)
- **Status Bars** — HP/MP/SP with custom names, colors. Dozens of status effect icons.
- **Attribute Panel** — Multi-dimensional stats (STR/DEX/CON/INT/WIS/CHA) with radar chart.
- **Skills** — Track skill ownership, levels, and descriptions.
- **Equipment** — Per-character slot configs with 6 racial templates (Human, Orc, Centaur, Lamia, Winged, Demon). Custom templates supported.
- **Reputation** — Custom faction categories with sub-dimensions.
- **Level / XP** — Experience formula with visual progress bars.
- **Currency** — Custom denominations with emoji icons and exchange rates.
- **Strongholds** — Tree-structured base/territory management.
- All modules are **independently toggleable**. Disabled = zero token cost.

### Smart Token Management
- **Auto Summary & Hide** — Automatically compresses old messages into AI-generated summaries. Original messages are `/hide`d to save tokens. Summaries can be toggled back to original events anytime.
- **Vector Memory** — Semantic search engine that recalls hidden details when conversation touches historical events. Runs locally via Web Worker — zero API cost.
- **AI Batch Scan** — One-click retroactive analysis of entire chat history.
- **Change-Driven Output** — AI only outputs what changed this turn. No redundant state dumps.

### User Experience
- **Custom Tables** — Excel-style tables with AI auto-fill, row/column locking, undo/redo.
- **Theme Designer** — Visual theme editor with hue/saturation sliders, image decorations, day/night modes. Export & share themes as JSON.
- **Interactive Tutorial** — First-time users get a guided walkthrough of all features.
- **Custom Prompts** — Full control over system injection, batch scan, compression, and RPG prompts. Preset save/load system.
- **Config Profiles** — Export all settings as a JSON file. Card authors can share configs for one-click setup.
